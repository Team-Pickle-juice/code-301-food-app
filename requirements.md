## What are your stretch goals?

-	Allow users to prepare a meal with what they have in their pantry.

## Non-Functional Requirements 

### Usability
- Our project will have a profile page that shows all infomation for a user. That way, it is easy to see and the user does not have to navigate to different pages to look for information. 

### Testability
- We are going to create multiple user accounts in our database and add meals to each user's meal plan table. We will test the update and delete functionality as well. The team will make sure to only push code that has been tested and validated good.
